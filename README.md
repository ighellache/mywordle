# mywordle
- 5 letter must set length of word to 5 letters e.g. word.length == 5
- must restrict number of tries to 6 to guess the word - so set an integer counter variable
- add colour of tiles so e.g. green if the letter is correct spot, 
yellow if letter in the word but wrong spot, and grey if the word not in the spot at all
- must ensure only single letter inputs so input === '', and typeOf input !== int or float
and input.length !> 1 and !< 1
- in the actual game you have 6 rows - can only use letter once in each keyboard
- can ensure keyboard button press corrsponds to actual letter
- oh so six rows gives you six tries
- must ensure word input is actual word
- if you get whole word right turn every letter to green and stop game for winner
